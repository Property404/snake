# Snake
Classic arcade game Snake with a twist  
Play [here](https://dagans.dev/projects/snake/)

## Rules
Use the arrow keys to move around the board and collect food.  
Each piece of food you collect makes you grow longer. Careful you don't run into yourself!  
As opposed to other versions of Snake, you can move through walls.  

Occasionally, a rival snake will join the fray.
